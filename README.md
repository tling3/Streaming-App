# Streaming-App

I wrote this application that served as one of the core projects within a React & Redux course on Udemy. I gained a ton of knowledge and earned a great skill set working with some great technology.  The application itself and the technology involved is described below.

## Streaming-App Description

The Streaming-App allows for clients/browsers to view the live streaming of a desktop. An example of this application would be something like the streaming service, 'Twitch'. Although, this is a much more simplified version of a streaming application used for academic purposes.

## Streaming-App Technology

Below is a list of the technologies that were involved in making this project. There is also short descriptions for the role they played in the project.

* React - Javascript library used for building user interfaces or UI components.
* React-Router-Dom - library of navigational components used for React.
* Redux - state (data) container for Javascript applications.
* React-Redux - React bindings for Redux (further enable compatability between React and Redux).
* Redux-Thunk - middleware that allows async logic that interacts with the Redux store.
* Redux-Form - library to manage form state in Redux.
* Redux Dev Tools - browser extension for Google Chrome for debugging the application's state changes.
* OAuth2 - registered application with Google to enable Google Sign-In and conduct OAuth2 authentication.
* GAPI - installed Google's API to access Javascript library and initialize with OAuth.
* Json-Server - mock REST API. This served as the API to manage data per stream.
* Node-Media-Server - Node.js implementation of RTMP/HTTP-FLV/WS-FLV/HLS/DASH Media Server. Real Time Messaging Protocol server that connected a Streamer's broadcast to a viewer's browser.
* flv.js - HTML5 Flash Video (FLV) Player written in pure JavaScript without Flash. Served as the application's video player.
* Axios - promise based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js.
* Lodash - JavaScript utility library for modularity, performance, and other extras.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
